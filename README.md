# Sound Board Project
This project involved using HTML5 audio tags to create a simple sound board. Each audio element is controlled by JavaScript. Clicking on a button will begin the sound, while clicking on another button will stop the sound already playing and start playing the new one.

I came up with a "calming" theme to my sound board, employing soothing sounds, such as the ocean, a crackling fireplace, and chirping birds, as well as relaxing colors and fonts.

## Objective
* Use the JavaScript API for audio elements:
  * .play method to play a sound when clicked.
  * .pause method and setting current time to 0 to stop a sound when another button is clicked.
